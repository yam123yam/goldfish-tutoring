# Update Repository Guide

This script provides step-by-step instructions on how to update your repository using Git and Bash commands.

---

## 1. Navigate to Your Repository

Open a terminal (Git Bash, VS Code Terminal, or any Bash terminal) and change the directory to your project folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repository

```bash
git pull origin main

```bash
git add .

```bash
git add filename.extension

```bash
git commit -m "Describe the changes you've made"

```bash
git push origin main



This `README.md` provides all the necessary steps for updating a repository, pulling changes, committing, and pushing, and it is in a single file. You can copy this into a `README.md` file and use it for reference or distribute it as needed.
